Note:
Please find the Database schema in /mod/model.js
We choose mongodb because this situation is to store pages, which are document-like.
The schema is simple enough to understand.
In particular, we use array to store the posting lists and forward table lists instead of objects, which allows more efficient retrieval of postings one by one later on in the project.
